## 🚨 The Problem

AI systems now decide who gets hired, who gets a loan, and who receives medical care. These systems silently learn from biased historical data and repeat discrimination at massive scale — without anyone checking.

- **Amazon's hiring AI** rejected women for 4 years — undetected
- **COMPAS algorithm** labeled Black defendants as high-risk at 2× the rate
- **138 million patients** were affected by a biased US hospital AI system
- **50M+ loan applications** in India are decided by AI annually — no fairness audit exists

**No accessible tool exists for the people who make these decisions.** IBM AIF360, Microsoft Fairlearn, and Google What-If Tool all require Python expertise. FairSight AI fixes that.

## ✅ Our Solution

FairSight AI is a web platform where any organization can:

1. **Upload** any CSV dataset (hiring, loan, medical, education, government)
2. **Detect** bias automatically using 3 industry-standard metrics
3. **Understand** bias through Google Gemini plain-language explanation
4. **Fix** bias with 1 click — no coding required
5. **Download** a professional AI-generated audit report

**Time to complete:** Under 5 minutes. **Cost:** Free.
